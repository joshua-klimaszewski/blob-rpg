Project: Gilded Labyrinth - Skill Tree Architecture

1. Skill Taxonomy (The 25/25/25/25 Rule)

When synthesizing a new class, distribute skills across these four tiers:

Tier

Type

Purpose

A

Passives

Base stat increases (HP Up, Sword Mastery). Often act as "Gates" for Tier B/C.

B

Actives

Bread-and-butter attacks (Line hits, Splash damage, Multihits).

C

Synergy

Skills that require conditions (e.g., "Deal 2x damage to Bound targets").

D

Ultimates

"Force Breaks" or massive high-cost skills that shift the momentum.

2. Core Archetype Blueprints

The Protector (Tank): Focuses on "Line Guards" and "Elemental Walls" (prediction-based mitigation).

The Landsknecht (DPS): Uses "Links"—if an ally hits the target, the Landsknecht follows up automatically.

The Medic (Healer): Maintenance of Binds/Ailments and "Overhealing."

The Specialist (Dark Hunter): Gains massive power only when the enemy is fully disabled.

3. Progression Synergies (FF6/FFT/EO)

Stat Growth (FF6): Artifacts/Magicite equipped at the moment of Level Up provide permanent stat bonuses (+1 STR), allowing for "Custom Builds" of standard classes.

Sub-classing: At a specific milestone, players choose a second tree. They get access to the sub-class skills at a lower level cap.

JP Spillover (FFT): A percentage of Job Points earned by one character is distributed to the rest of the party to reduce the "Grind" for new classes.

4. Synthesis Formula for New Classes

Identify the "Hook": (e.g., "A class that gains power by being at low HP").

Define the Setups: Create skills that help them reach that state (e.g., "Life Tap").

Define the Payoff: Create skills that reward that state (e.g., "Vengeance Strike").

Connect to Binds: Ensure their payoff skill does even more damage if a specific Bind is active.
