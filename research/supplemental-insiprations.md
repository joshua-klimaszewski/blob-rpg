Supplemental Research: 10 Additional Mechanical Sources

This document expands the "Gilded Labyrinth" mechanical DNA by analyzing 10 additional titles that solve specific problems regarding Mobile UX, Combat Depth, or Economic Loops.

Category 1: Combat Geometry & Positioning

1. Radiant Historia (The Grid Manipulator)

The Hook: Combat takes place on a 3x3 grid. Enemies occupy specific tiles.

The Mechanic: Skills don't just deal damage; they Push (Back), Pull (Forward), or Shift (Left/Right) enemies.

Application: If you push 3 enemies into the same tile, they "stack." A single AOE spell now hits all 3 at once.

Mobile Synergy: Swipe gestures in combat could correspond to pushing enemies (e.g., Swipe Right on enemy -> Push enemy Right).

2. Into the Breach (Determinism)

The Hook: You see exactly what the enemy will do next turn.

The Mechanic: If an enemy is aiming at a building, you can push them so they aim at another enemy instead.

Application: Removes RNG frustration on mobile. The "Puzzle" is finding the sequence of swipes to negate all damage.

3. Darkest Dungeon (Rank & Stress)

The Hook: Linear party positioning (Rank 1, 2, 3, 4).

The Mechanic:

Positioning: A "Knight" can only use Sword skills in Rank 1 or 2. If shuffled to Rank 4, they are useless.

Stress: A second health bar. If it fills, the character gains a "Virtue" (Buff) or "Affliction" (Debuff + acts uncontrollably).

Application: Adds consequences to the "Coven" layout. If your Vanguard dies, your Rearguard (Squishy Mages) falls to the front and can't cast.

4. Vagrant Story (Body Part Targeting)

The Hook: You don't attack "The Bandit"; you attack "The Bandit's Right Arm."

The Mechanic:

Right Arm: -50% STR.

Legs: -50% Agility/Movement.

Head: Silence spells.

Application: Direct ancestor to Etrian Odyssey, but focuses on weapon affinity (Piercing/Edged/Blunt). Encourages swapping gear mid-fight.

Category 2: Economy & Progression Loops

5. Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale (Capitalism)

The Hook: You are the Shopkeeper.

The Mechanic:

Haggling: Buying low from adventurers, selling high to customers.

Window Display: Putting rare items in the window attracts richer customers (unlocks higher tier "Town Phase").

Application: Since your loop is "Dungeon -> Shop," lean into the selling. Don't just auto-sell; make the "Selling" a mini-game that dictates how fast the shop levels up.

6. Golden Sun (The Djinn System)

The Hook: Collectible creatures (Djinn) that attach to characters.

The Mechanic:

Set Mode: Djinn provide passive stats and change your Class (e.g., Fire Djinn on a Water Mage makes them a "Sage").

Standby Mode: You "Use" the Djinn to cast a spell (Unleash). It detaches, lowering your stats, but charging your "Summon" meter.

Application: A dynamic version of FF6 Magicite. Risk/Reward: Detach your stats to fire a nuke?

7. Loop Hero (Deck Building the World)

The Hook: The character walks automatically. You build the dungeon.

The Mechanic: You play cards to place "Mountains" (HP Boost), "Swamps" (Healing -> Damage), or "Vampire Mansions" (Adds tough enemies).

Application: In a procedural dungeon, let the player use "Map Cards" to alter the next room (e.g., "Place a Shrine here to heal, but it spawns 2 Ghosts").

Category 3: Mobile UX & Turn Economy

8. Octopath Traveler (Break & Boost)

The Hook: Shield Points.

The Mechanic:

Break: Hit a weakness to lower Shield. At 0, enemy is Stunned + takes 2x damage.

Boost: Store BP each turn. Spend BP to attack 4 times in one turn.

Application: The "Break" system is the most mobile-friendly way to implement tactical depth without complex menus. Tap weakness -> Enemy Stunned.

9. Persona Q / Q2 (The "Boost" State)

The Hook: Hitting a weakness makes your next skill free.

The Mechanic: If you hit a weakness, you enter "Boost." Next turn: 0 Mana cost + Priority movement. If you get hit, you lose Boost.

Application: Solves the "MP conservation" issue in long dungeons. If you play smart, you can fight indefinitely.

10. Shiren the Wanderer (Item Identification)

The Hook: You find a "Red Pot." You don't know what it does.

The Mechanic:

Use it: It might heal you. It might explode.

Throw it: Hit an enemy with it to test effects.

Identify Scroll: Reveals the tag.

Application: Adds massive tension to the exploration phase. "I'm dying... do I drink this unknown potion?"

Synthesis: Recommended "Gems" for Gilded Labyrinth

From Radiant Historia: Add Push/Pull mechanics to your skills. If a player swipes "Forward" to attack, maybe it knocks the enemy back 1 tile.

From Recettear: Make the Shop Interface distinct. The "Unlock" mechanic from EO is great, but adding a "Haggling" or "Request" board gives the town phase more life.

From Golden Sun: The Djinn Class Change is a perfect evolution of the FF6 Magicite system. Let the "Artifacts" players find change their class name and available skills dynamically.
