Extended Research: UI/UX & Turn Economy

This document explores additional mechanics from Labyrinth of Refrain, Slay the Spire, and Bravely Default to optimize the mobile DRPG experience.

1. Squad-Based Management (Labyrinth of Refrain)

The Problem: Managing 6 separate skill trees and gear sets on a 6-inch screen is tedious.
The Solution: The "Coven" System.

The Pact: Players equip a "Pact" item in a slot. A Pact has 1–3 character slots.

Squad Logic: You command the Pact, not the individual. The Pact has its own skill set derived from the characters inside it.

Benefit: Allows for "Battalion" scale combat with simplified "Squad" commands, perfect for mobile tapping.

2. Turn Banking: Brave & Default (Bravely Default)

The Problem: Standard turn-based combat can feel slow on mobile.
The Solution: Turn Debt/Credit.

Default: The character defends and stores 1 BP (Brave Point).

Brave: Spend BP to take up to 4 actions in a single turn.

Risk: You can go into "BP Debt" (negative BP) to take 4 actions immediately, but you will be frozen for the next 3 turns.

Mobile Synergy: Allows players to "Burst" down easy encounters in 1 turn by going into debt, speeding up the "Grind" phase of the loop.

3. Node-Based Navigation (Slay the Spire)

The Problem: Manual grid-stepping can feel "fiddly" on mobile over long distances.
The Solution: Node Pathing for Fast-Travel.

The Concept: While the "Frontier" (unexplored) is a PMD-style grid, "Cleared" areas can be represented as a node-map.

Interaction: Tap a "Resource Node" or "Stairway Node" to auto-path there, triggering any "Danger Bar" checks along the way in a single animation.

4. Item "Durability" as a Dive Timer (Fire Emblem/Darkest Dungeon)

The Problem: How to force the "Return to Town" loop without just using "HP/TP."
The Solution: Inventory Degradation.

Light/Torch: As you explore, your "Visibility" (and thus map-auto-fill radius) shrinks.

Supply Scarcity: Specific items like "Pickaxes" or "Shovels" have 3 uses. Once broken, you can't harvest the high-tier loot, forcing a return to town to restock.
