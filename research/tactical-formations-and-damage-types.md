Research: The "Union" System & "Hard Counter" Ballistics

This document explores the mechanics of Yggdra Union (Formation Combat), StarCraft (Damage Types), and Stella Glow (Field Tuning).

Goal: Create a combat system where Positioning defines Participation, and Unit Type defines Survivability.

1. The Union System (Yggdra Union)

1.1 The Mechanic: "Formation is Action"

In standard RPGs, you command units one by one. In Yggdra Union, you command a Leader, and their position determines who else fights.

Male Units: Form an 'X' Union (Diagonals).

Female Units: Form a '+' Union (Cardinals).

Heavy Units: Form a '■' Union (All adjacent tiles).

1.2 The Mobile Application

Instead of tapping 5 different characters to say "Attack," the player moves the Coven Leader to a tile.

The Trigger: The game automatically detects all allies in the Leader's "Union Pattern."

The Clash: A 1v1 battle becomes a 3v3 or 5v5 battle instantly based on grid proximity.

Tactical Depth: You must position your Healers and Mages in the correct "slots" relative to the Leader to ensure they get dragged into the combo.

2. Ballistics & Hard Counters (StarCraft)

Most RPGs use "Fire beats Ice." StarCraft uses "Physics beats Biology." This adds a visceral layer to the "Squad/Coven" composition.

2.1 Damage Types

Normal: 100% damage to everything. (Standard Swords)

Concussive: 100% to Small, 50% to Medium, 25% to Large. (Grenades/Blunt)

Role: Anti-Infantry/Anti-Swarm. Useless against Bosses (Large).

Explosive: 50% to Small, 75% to Medium, 100% to Large. (Greatswords/Cannons)

Role: Boss Killers. Inefficient against swarms (overkill).

Splash: Deals 100% to target, 50% to adjacent tiles, 25% to rim tiles. (Magic/Breath)

2.2 Armor Types (The "Coven" Defense)

Light (Biological): Fast, evasive, takes full damage from Concussive. (Rogues/Mages)

Armored (Mechanical): High DEF, takes full damage from Explosive. (Knights/Golems)

Psionic (Shields): Regenerating shield layer. Takes 200% from "EMP" or "Anti-Magic" sources.

2.3 Synthesis for Gilded Labyrinth

Enemy Design: Don't just make "Fire Elementals." Make "Massive Golems" (Large/Armored).

The Trap: If the player brings a "Concussive" squad (Thieves/Monks), they will do 25% damage to the Golem. They need an "Explosive" squad (Mages/Warriors).

3. The "Tactic Card" (Yggdra Union x FFT)

3.1 One Card Per Turn

At the start of the turn, the player selects One Card from their deck (like a Tarot card).

Movement Value: The card defines the total steps the party can take (e.g., "Steal" card = 12 Move).

Power: The card defines the Attack Power for the Union Clash.

Ace Effect: The card grants a special skill (e.g., "Steal Items," "Banish Undead," "Refresh Mana").

3.2 Mobile Synergy

This solves the "Too Many Buttons" problem.

Start Turn: Swipe through your deck. Pick "The Chariot" (High Move, Low Power).

Move Phase: Move your units into position using the card's movement points.

Attack Phase: Trigger a Union. The "Chariot" effect activates, giving everyone a temporary shield.

4. Tuning & Resonance (Stella Glow)

4.1 The "Song" Field

The Mechanic: A character ("Witch") can spend their turn "Singing."

The Effect: While singing, they cannot move or act, but they generate a Global Aura.

Song of Iron: All allies take -20% Physical Damage.

Song of Wind: +2 Move Range to all allies.

The Risk: The singer is vulnerable. If hit, the song breaks (Concentration check).

4.2 Application

Use this for your "Support Covens." They don't fight; they hang back and "Channel" a field effect that buffs the Frontline Union.

5. Master Synthesis: The "Union Clash" Loop

Step

Action

Yggdra Union

4. Clash

Attack the Boss (Large/Armored). Tank deals Explosive Dmg (Effective). Mage deals Splash.
